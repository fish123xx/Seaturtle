Puppet
Puppet by Perforce is an industry-leading configuration management and IT automation tool that helps manage the configuration of servers and other IT infrastructure. It enables users to define the desired state of their systems in a declarative language and automates the process of bringing systems into that state, maintaining consistency and compliance across IT environments. Puppet supports a variety of tasks, including configuration management, compliance, CI/CD, patch management, and more. Puppet works by compiling a catalog of desired state configurations for each node (server or system) it manages and then applying these configurations to ensure the actual state matches the desired state.
