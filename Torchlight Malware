1.	Type: Torchlight is classified as a linux backdoor malware.

2.	Developed and Used by COSMIC WOLF: This indicates that Sea Turtle not only uses Torchlight but is also responsible for its development.

3.	Targeting Profile: The malware is specifically targeted, which aligns with Sea Turtle’s strategic approach to cyber espionage.

4.	Functionality: Torchlight operates as a Linux backdoor. Its primary function is to use ICMP Echo Requests, commonly known as ping messages, to trigger shell command execution on the infected system. This approach suggests a sophisticated method of remote control, where standard network traffic is used for malicious purposes.


Dive into Torchlight Malware 

Infrastructure and IOCs - 
•	Exemplar Sample: Torchlight sample has a SHA256 hash of 7a4114049b66a4eeb36a2b71868860865744ad089094c8e54d274fa73fa69c41.

•	Command and Control (C2) Domain: Configured with ping.querryfiles[.]com, which resolves to IP address 104.248.208[.]202.

•	Root Domain: querryfiles[.]com, resolving to 93.115.22[.]212. This IP was previously used by COSMIC WOLF in an intrusion in the MENA region.

•	Python Reverse-Shell Script: In early September 2023, a Python reverse-shell script with SHA256 hash 

•	e5705863dc4c73246267bd46fb6bd4723c45e1b2ea861fd382aff18676cc3452 was configured with 104.248.208[.]202 as its C2 host.

•	Infrastructure Reuse: The reuse of infrastructure across multiple tools and over time is atypical for COSMIC WOLF, who usually cycles through C2 infrastructure for operations security.

•	Additional Domains and IPs:
•	ybcd[.]tech (initially colocated with querryfiles[.]com at 93.115.22[.]212, later moved to 168.100.10[.]187).
•	ai-connector.goldchekin[.]com and ai-connector.splendor[.]org, both resolving to 168.100.10[.]187.



ISPs and Hosting
•	ISPs Used: DigitalOcean, MVPS Ltd., and BL-Networks.
Assessment – 
Sea Turtle shows proficiency in targeting Linux-based systems and expanding its custom tooling.The group uses previously unobserved ISPs while still favouring known providers like DigitalOcean. Sea Turtle’s infrastructure reuse and the use of a Cloudflare account for over a year suggest the potential for maintaining hosting and administration assets for future use.
